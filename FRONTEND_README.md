## Smart Contract Integration

The frontend integrates with the Clarity smart contract through the `BlockchainService` class:

### Key Functions

- `addStudentRecord()` - Add new student performance records
- `getStudentRecord()` - Retrieve student records
- `authorizeEducator()` - Grant educator access
- `revokeEducator()` - Revoke educator access
- `isAuthorizedEducator()` - Check educator permissions

### Contract Address

- **Testnet:** `ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFYVDGX8MNSYVEJSXKT136DCPEHW.decentralized-report-card`
- **Mainnet:** (To be deployed)

## Usage Guide

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
VITE_NETWORK=testnet  # or mainnet
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFYVDGX8MNSYVEJSXKT136DCPEHW
VITE_CONTRACT_NAME=decentralized-report-card
```

### Network Configuration

The app automatically detects the environment:
- **Development:** Uses Stacks testnet
- **Production:** Uses Stacks mainnet

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run test` - Run tests

### Code Style

- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Functional components with hooks
- Proper error handling
- Loading states for UX

### Testing

```bash
npm run test
```

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Set environment variables
3. Deploy automatically on push

### Netlify

1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Upload the `dist` folder
3. Configure environment variables

### Manual Deployment

1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Upload `dist` contents to your web server
3. Configure your server for SPA routing

## Security Considerations

- All transactions are signed by the user's wallet
- No private keys are stored in the application
- Smart contract validation prevents unauthorized access
- Immutable records ensure data integrity
- Transparent verification through blockchain

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Wallet Connection Failed**
   - Ensure you have a Stacks wallet installed
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify wallet is unlocked

2. **Transaction Failed**
   - Check if you have sufficient STX for fees
   - Verify you're on the correct network
   - Ensure you're authorized for the action

3. **Records Not Loading**
   - Check blockchain network status
   - Verify contract address is correct
   - Check browser console for errors

### Support

For issues or questions:
- Check the browser console for error messages
- Verify your wallet connection
- Ensure you're on the correct network
- Contact the development team
